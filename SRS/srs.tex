\chapter{Overview}

\section{Product Perspective}
This application is essential for consolidating various bookkeeping operations susceptible to errors and irregularities. The manual handling of these tasks separately by different halls at IIT Kharagpur can result in redundancies and inconsistencies. Moreover, students lack a straightforward mechanism to manage their interactions with their respective halls. For instance, filing complaints often necessitates students to personally approach multiple individuals for resolution, sometimes without any centralized complaint records, thus lacking accountability. Numerous such scenarios offer opportunities for digitization and the associated benefits. This document outlines our vision for a web application designed to address these challenges in a user-friendly manner.
\section{Product Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Registration
    \item Complaint resolution
    \item Notifying students
    \item Dues settlement
    \item Grant management
    \item Budgeting
    \item Personnel management
\end{enumerate}
\section{Client Classes and Characteristics}
The following client classes have been categorized according to the subset of product features they utilize. Each client class is provided with a distinct interface within the application, accessing functions that are pertinent to their respective roles.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Students}: Pay various fees and dues, register and view complaints, View notices.
  \item \textit{Mess managers}: Handle and log the day-to-day expenditures of the mess, Generate menu on a monthly basis.
  \item \textit{Hall managers}: Manages Registration of students into the Hall and allocates rooms in an automated fashion, Manage the employment and salaries of temporary hall employees, Manage Hall expenses, Creates notices, generates action taken reports(ATR). 
  \item \textit{Wardens}: View ATRs, Manage payments to hall and mess managers, handle financial grants from the HMC, Generate dues for the student, allocate finances to hall and mess
  \item \textit{The HMC}: View various expenditures, Allocation of grants to different halls  
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \caption{User classes}
    \label{fig:user_classes}
\end{figure}

\section{Operating Environment}
The application is designed to utilize the platform-agnostic \textbf{Python 3.0+} interpreter along with associated frameworks. The application server responsible for handling incoming requests can run on any platform equipped with a TCP/IP stack supporting \textbf{Django 4.0+} and \textbf{Python 3.0+}. As a result, the web application can be deployed on Windows Server or Linux-based distributions that support these tools.\\
For optimal functionality, the server should be connected to the local area network provided by the Computer and Informatics Centre at IIT KGP and appropriately configured to handle incoming requests. Any relevant firewall settings must be adjusted to allow high traffic to the server without dropping any requests.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Developers are limited to using Python for providing the backend services for the web application for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Professors have enforced a rule necessitating the usage of either \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Java} or \textbf{Python}. This eliminates the possibility of writing the codebase with just \textbf{HTML}, \textbf{CSS} and \textbf{JavaScript} for the front-end combined with \textbf{JavaScript} on the backend (\textbf{Node.js}, etc.)
    \item \textbf{C++} and \textbf{Java} do not possess easy to use, batteries included frameworks like \textbf{Python}. The development time available for this project is less than three weeks. This necessitates the usage of pre-built mechanisms and libraries that Python possesses.

With these two constraints in mind, we have decided to use \textbf{Python} along with the \textbf{Django} framework for the web application.
\end{enumerate}
% \chapter{System Features}
% "IICT WEBSITE" is a result processing web software. So the main art of this product is to enter data of results and publish. 

\section{User Documentation}
The web application will feature a self-documenting, intuitive interface that eliminates the need for specific manuals for users. All relevant information regarding the usage of the web application will be strategically placed within the different webpages and displayed as needed, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all users.


\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The existence of a local network within the KGP campus. If this is absent, additional configuration would be required in terms of DNS, hosting, ISP handling, etc.
    \item End users should be able to connect to this network, otherwise access to the application will be limited to those with direct access to the servers. 
    \item The network should not have significant downtimes that can affect the utility of the application and its ability to handle incoming requests.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{Class_Functionalities.png}
    \caption{Classes and their functionalities}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The hardware used for this needs to be server computer with a processor fast enough to handle a large number of requests simultaneously. Preferably a multi-core system with distributed processes across the core will be suitable.
    \item Solid state drives instead of hard disks to boost the speed of information retrieval. Enables faster request handling.
    \item RAID systems to manage data redundancy. Ensures no user data is lost because of storage device failures by maintaining redundant copies as backup.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Software Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Web browser needed on the end-users' systems to access the web application
    \item Graphical user interfaces combined with the browsers needed. Command-line interface will not be able to meaningfully handle the user interfaces provided in the web application.
    \item In order to set up the system, some web server like Heroku may be needed for deployment.Currently the system runs on the local device of the user.
    \item The client will need an active email address for verification.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Communications Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system uses a standard TCP/IP stack available on most operating systems.
    \item The system uses the \textbf{HTTP} protocol to deliver web pages and handle user login
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Server Up-time}
The system needs to keep running for long periods of time for accessibility so the hardware needs to be capable of that. Moreover the maintenance frequency needs to be low to have a stable experience for the end users.\subsection{Response Time}
The system needs to have a good response time as it will be repetitively used by various stakeholders in the Institute and the response time needs to keep up with the incoming requests. At the same time less used tasks like printing bills at the end of the month can be a little slow since they will be accessed much less frequently.
\subsection{System Dependability}
It determines the failure rate of the system, that is, the cases when the system receives an incorrect input or there is a random failure. The end user needs to be notified in such a scenario.
\subsection{Prominent Documents}
Since the system is also being used to maintain cash receipts and expenditure through the halls and generate official documents for the students' stay in their halls, the output needs to be clear, concise and consistent in a .pdf or another similar printable format.



\section{Safety Requirements}
There needs to be a regular audit to the cash flow through the hall since there is no check for the information entered by the mess manager. Moreover, audit also needs to be done for the budget distribution as there might be cases for fraud in the long run if left unchecked since the system is not verifying the data in any manner.

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Secure Login}
The system should be protected against forced and malicious login attempts to access the software. The web interface needs to be continuously patched to fix bugs as and when they crop up.
\subsection{Verifiable Access}
The system is designed to serve multiple parties and their levels of access and their permissions are decided by their login IDs. Thus, the login and access to functionality should be robust and extremely secure since the system also deals with the finances of the institute.
\subsection{Student Information Must be Secure}
All the personal student information stored by the system should be safe and secure.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
\subsection{Reliability}
The system must be dependable, which means it must constantly perform as expected with very low downtime and rate of failure. In absence of this the HCM will not be able to function smoothly.
\subsection{Information Accessibility}
To save the login credentials and the myriad types of data that the software uses, the application should be able to save, access and alter files on the system so that the information is retained even on successive runs.
\subsection{Maintainability}
The program should be easy to modify and add features to. The code should be clearly commented and the features well documented to allow for easy maintenance. The frameworks used should be well supported by their developers well into the future.
